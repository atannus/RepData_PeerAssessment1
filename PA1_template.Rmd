## Libraries.

Some effort was put into making this document dependant on a few libraries as possible.
The only requirement is the ggplot2 library.
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
